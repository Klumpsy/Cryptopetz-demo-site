        Hello Fellow Explorers! <br/><br/>
            
        Happy Thursday folks, it's been a fun few weeks introducing our project to all our great new community members!  
        We've seen lots of growth on our social media channels, doesn't hurt being the first Cardano project 
        mentioned on the BitBoy Crypto channel haha, seeing roughly 1K new Followers on Twitter and 600 new Discord Members!  
        Which brings me to some much needed expressions of thanks! Our Petz Helpers and Origin Explorers have always 
        been a great resource for info on the project and have helped to build a passionate positive community, 
        thank you all for your early support, we appreciate you. Further, we would like to thank Kekshot directly 
        for his consistent guidance to new community members and the amazing "Starter" videos he has been producing, 
        he devotes a lot of consideration to his work and we respect that!  You can find his Videos in our Starter 
        Guide Channel on Discord. Thank you all, Together we run Far.
        <br/><br/>

        Next up, we are happy to announce we have signed with Cathar Games, 
        a full-stack game development studio based in Qu√©bec City, Canada. 
        With an average nearing a decade of experience, at companies including Ubisoft, 
        the Cathar team started their journey with a focus on helping indie projects launch and get exposure. 
        With over 30 projects launched, Cathar have honed their skills and have developed expertise in areas 
        such as MMO game development.  They will work in tandem with our team to deliver "Arena Battles" 
        to the hands of our community, and they will be packaging each "Development Milestone" for user 
        interaction so we can have discussions about honing the final product!  The contract with them puts 
        the completion of this portion of the project out into Q3 next year! Along those lines, we have 
        finalized the initial concept art with ZVKY, they will now finish up the Team Builder Art/Design 
        for us to add to.  Working alongside these Development Companies comes with contractual deadlines 
        and gives us a solid foundation to stand on when trying to develop our timeline, based on those new 
        timelines we will adjust and release an updated Roadmap to help folks see our vision for the games future! 
        <br/><br/>

        To our Delegators, gosh what can we say, number go up!  
        The PETZ Stake pool has 200 delegators now, that's an addition of 60 new explorers, 
        helping to further decentralize the Cardano Ecosystem, and we couldn't be more proud to 
        have you aboard as we Celebrate breaking 1.09M Staked!  Everyone staking is quietly earning Egg Shards, 
        our in-game resource, and can claim them at their leisure, they'll accrue each epoch and don't expire!

        Onwards and Upwards
