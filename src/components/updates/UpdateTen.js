        <h2>Update December 16th 2021</h2>
        <p>
        Hello Fellow Explorers! <br/><br/>
            
        The work has begun with Cathar, 
        and the first task is to provide and develop on a Complete Art Asset List to draw from while building out our first 
        "Milestone".  As the Game Dev continues we continue to story craft and explore deeper into the Adano Ecosystem, 
        and to that end, I'll be dropping The Epoch 1 Petz Details document in our Game-Info channel on Discord, providing 
        all sorts of new in-depth information about our Petz!  It details the Size, Sleeping Habits, 
        Climate and Biome for each and every one!  I hope you all are inspired while reading about your favorite Petz life-style, 
        they are each such unique creatures and we still have much to discover about them!
        <br/><br/>

        Speaking of all the Petz! We've formatted our CryptoPetz banner to work with the Twitter Banners feature 
        and will be airdropping one to each of our Early Explorers.  
        These are a thank you to our Origin Explorers and Petz Helper roles in our Discord. Happy holidays!
        <br/><br/>

        Gosh, it's getting late in the year, and in some places, seasons are changing! 
        All around us we see the indications of the holidays approach,
        lights in windows and evergreen garland, and also the sometimes hectic preparations made around busy lives, 
        dear friends, and family.  
        That time is often stretched thin, and while laughs and hugs are still shared, stress can be high.  
        So during this time remember to create moments for yourself to breath and enjoy!  
        Your mental health is important to us, and you're always welcome in our Discord to talk and hang out with friends if you need. 
        Our team will be taking a break from our Bi-Weekly Update schedule through the holidays (returning on 1/13), 
        but will continue to be active in our social media channels, engaging with the community, answering questions, 
        making announcements, and keeping folks company.  
        I've provided a link under 'Today's Updates' to the Mayo Clinic's website regarding stress and depression during the holidays, 
        we love you all.

        Onwards and Upwards
