        Hello Fellow Explorers! <br/><br/>
            
        Diving right in, so as not to bury the lead, as of last week, 
        we have signed the paperwork to begin work with ZVKY, a well-respected design and gaming company 
        for overall support with in-game artwork and design.  
        Our Devs will complete Wallet Integration utilizing this New V2 Team Builder and our community will 
        be able to strategize their teams with new levels of insight!  Letz Go!
        <br/><br/>

        We continue to Puppet-master the suits and ties as we finish signing with a North American gaming company 
        for committed game development as they are more comfortable with blockchain and share our long-term vision 
        and excitement for the game. 
        <br/><br/>
