                    Hello Fellow Explorers! <br/><br/>
                    
                    It's time for another bi-weekly update!  It may have been a wild few weeks in the Market, 
                    but it's been steady on forward for the Crypto Petz Team.  Most recently, the Crypto Petz Cardano Stake Pool 
                    [PETZ] was announced and as of today, with help from our community, we have 380K+ ADA staked in our pool!  
                    Thank you for helping to support Cardano's Decentralization! <br/><br/>
                    
                    The Petz Pool plays a larger part in-game as well, and to that point, we have released a Story Line 
                    Teaser with some concept art focused around the pool's in-game equivalent, The Egg Shard Laboratory! 
                    The Egg Shards Research and Laboratory Development 
                    are on-going, we will continue to release further updates on the Egg Shard uses.  
                    You can see the concept art, story teaser, and more <span className ="emph">@ cryptopetz.io/stake-pool</span> <br/><br/>

                    Also today, the Team Builder will receive it's first bug fix update and, to begin receiving specific 
                    feedback on it, we have launched the Team Builder Improvement Channel!  We are excited to begin our 
                    Community Game Development with you all, and will be going over the Final Draft of our Token Mechanics 
                    this next week so we are all ready for Team Builder Wallet Integration in October!  
                    From that point forward we can work together to hone the battle mechanics that will be utilized 
                    in the Alpha Battle Simulator later on this year!
