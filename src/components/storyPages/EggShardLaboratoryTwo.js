            Months passed as we studied our new home, and others had begun to appear on our borders,
            apparently the same event that had brought our ship here, was still bringing others. 
            First, an agricultural vessel piloted by a family of hydroponic farmers, an Automated Robotic Barge piloted 
            by a very strange inventor, and an old Leisure Cruiser near full capacity, 
            with a large Gymnasium, a last gen Med-Pod and Bio-Polymer Device in the Spa. 
            <br/><br/>
            We've landed the Cruise Liner near a cliff lined coast on a green expanse of prairie.
            Folks have begun to set up merchant stalls and a farmers market leading up to the vessel and 
            lovingly dubbed it Cruise City.
